				<li><b>Amazon Comprehend</b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Comprehend uses ML and natural language processing (NLP) to help you uncover the insights and relationships in your unstructured data. This service performs the following functions: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Identifies the language of the text</li>
					<li>Extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events</li>
					<li>Understands how positive or negative the text is</li>
					<li>Analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech </li>
					<li>And automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic</li>
				</ul><br />
				<li><b>Amazon Translate</b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Translate is a neural machine translation service that delivers fast, high-quality, and affordable language translation. Neural machine translation is a form of language translation automation that uses deep learning models to deliver more accurate and more natural-sounding translation than traditional statistical and rule-based translation algorithms. With Amazon Translate, you can localize content such as websites and applications for your diverse users, translate large volumes of text for analysis, and efficiently implement cross-lingual communication between users. 
				</p>
				<li><b>Amazon Textract</b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Textract is a service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. Amazon Textract goes beyond optical character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of fields in forms and information stored in tables.
				</p>
				<li><b>Amazon Lex</b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Lex is a fully managed AI service to design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Amazon Lex provides the advanced deep learning functionalities of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text. This permits you to build applications with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions, and create new categories of products. With Amazon Lex, the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa are now available to any developer. You can efficiently build sophisticated, natural-language conversational bots and voice-enabled interactive voice response (IVR) systems. 
				</p>
				<li><b>Amazon Polly</b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Amazon Polly lets you create applications that talk, so you can build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Amazon Polly is an AI service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Amazon Polly includes a wide selection of lifelike voices spread across dozens of languages, so you can select the ideal voice and build speech-enabled applications that work in many different countries. 
				</p>
				<li><b>mazon Transcribe</b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service for automatically converting speech to text. The service can transcribe audio files stored in common formats, like WAV and MP3, with time stamps for every word so that you can quickly locate the audio in the original source by searching for the text. You can also send a live audio stream to Amazon Transcribe and receive a stream of transcripts in real time. Amazon Transcribe is designed to handle a wide range of speech and acoustic characteristics, including variations in volume, pitch, and speaking rate. Customers can use Amazon Transcribe for a variety of business applications, including the following: 
					<ul>
						<li>Transcription of voice-based customer service calls</li>
						<li>Generation of subtitles on audio and video content</li>
						<li>Conducting (text based) content analysis on audio and video content</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<li><b>Amazon Rekognition </b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Rekognition facilitates adding image and video analysis to your applications. It uses proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology that requires no ML expertise to use. With Amazon Rekognition, you can identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos, and even detect inappropriate content. Amazon Rekognition also provides highly accurate facial analysis and facial search capabilities. You can use it to detect, analyze, and compare faces for a wide variety of user verification, people counting, and public safety use cases. 
				</p>
				<li><b>Amazon Kendra</b></li>
				<p>
				Amazon Kendra is an intelligent search service powered by ML. Amazon Kendra reimagines enterprise search for your websites and applications.
